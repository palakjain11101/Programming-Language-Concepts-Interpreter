# Programming-Language-Concepts-Interpreter

Streams are potentially unbounded sequences of data. They are common in mathematics, computer science and everyday life. 
Examples of streams include streaming a movie on the web, a sequence of bits flowing through a wire in a digital circuit, or temperature measurements taken every hour. The theory of (discrete) signal processing deals with infinite
sequences of reals. Similarly, in computer science, dataflow is the study of networks of nodes and channels through which a potentially unbounded number of data elements flow. A particular
feature of streamed data is that streams may have different rates of accessing data associated with them.

Task: To design and implement a domain specific programming language that performs certain simple computations on potentially unbounded integer sequences. 

Requirements:
1. Invent an appropriate syntax,
2. Write an interpreter for the invented language using Haskell
3. Document the language in a written report
